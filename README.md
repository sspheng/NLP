A> WHAT IS NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING? 

Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence in which computers analyze, understand, process and generates meaning from human language in a smart and intelligent way. It focuses on the interactions between human language and computers .NLP is all about making computers understand and generate human language.

B> WHAT IS REGEX ?

Regular expressions or RegEx is defined as a sequence of characters that are mainly used to find or replace patterns present in the text. In simple words, we can say that a regular expression is a set of characters or a pattern that is used to find substrings in a given string.A regular expression (RE) is a language for specifying text search strings. It helps us to match or extract other strings or sets of strings, with the help of a specialized syntax present in a pattern. For Example, extracting all hashtags from a tweet, getting email iD or phone numbers, etc from large unstructured text content!

Regular Expressions (REGEX) are used in various tasks such as: 

**Data pre-processing,

Rule-based information Mining systems,

Pattern Matching,

Text feature Engineering,

Web scraping,

Data Extraction, etc.

**What are the steps to pre-processing data? 

There can be multiple ways of cleaning and pre-processing textual data such as: 

Removing tags.

Expanding contractions.

Stemming and lemmatization.

Tokenization.

Text lower casing.

C> STEPS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

Discourse Analysis: Discourse analysis may be defined as the process of performing text , determining contextual information or language analysis, which involves text interpretation and knowing the social interactions.  

Pragmatic Analysis: It is part of the process of extracting information from text. Specifically, it's the portion that focuses on taking structures set of text and figuring out what the actual meaning was.

D> WHAT IS SPEECH RECOGNITION?

Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is a capability which enables a program to process human speech into a written format. While it’s commonly confused with voice recognition, speech recognition focuses on the translation of speech from a verbal format to a text one whereas voice recognition just seeks to identify an individual user’s voice.

E> WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT SPEECH RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS?

The power behind speech recognition features comes from a set of algorithms and technologies. They include the following:

1. Hidden Markov model. HMMs are used in autonomous systems where a state is partially observable or when all of the information necessary to make a decision is not immediately available to the sensor (in speech recognition's case, a microphone). An example of this is in acoustic modeling, where a program must match linguistic units to audio signals using statistical probability.

2. Natural language processing. NLP eases and accelerates the speech recognition process.

3. N-grams. This simple approach to language models creates a probability distribution for a sequence. An example would be an algorithm that looks at the last few words spoken, approximates the history of the sample of speech and uses that to determine the probability of the next word or phrase that will be spoken.

4. Artificial intelligence. AI and machine learning methods like deep learning and neural networks are common in advanced speech recognition software. These systems use grammar, structure, syntax and composition of audio and voice signals to process speech. Machine learning systems gain knowledge with each use, making them well suited for nuances like accents.
